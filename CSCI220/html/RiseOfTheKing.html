  <article class="descript">Eighteen months ago, my world was tossed upside down amid horrified screams and merciless
    hellfire. I was thrown into the flames to burn alive, but now I stand on the other side, invincible, untouchable,
    and unbeatable.
    Today, the ID in my wallet says John D. Hamilton. It’s the name I go by, the name the beautiful brunette sitting
    alone in Ginnie’s diner knows me as.
    I was an undercover cop, once. A decorated agent who slid from my throne and descended into a world of pain and
    darkness. Then came Sophia Solomon, the light in my dark, the miracle who walks past my door and lends a little
    warmth in the dead of winter.
    Sophia‘s beauty steals the breath from my lungs. She draws me in just by existing, but she doesn’t know my secrets.
    I wasn’t born with the first name John, but then again, I wasn’t born a cocaine addict either, but here we are and
    both are true.
    Now I’m on a mission to find the man that had me killed.
    Rise Of The King is a Checkmate Series suspenseful romance. It’s a compete standalone and has no cliffhanger. New
    readers can start here. But beware, not everything is as it seems.</article>
