  <article class="descript">Near an isolated mansion lies a beautiful garden.

    In this garden grow luscious flowers, shady trees…and a collection of precious “butterflies”—young women who have
    been kidnapped and intricately tattooed to resemble their namesakes. Overseeing it all is the Gardener, a brutal,
    twisted man obsessed with capturing and preserving his lovely specimens.

    When the garden is discovered, a survivor is brought in for questioning. FBI agents Victor Hanoverian and Brandon
    Eddison are tasked with piecing together one of the most stomach-churning cases of their careers. But the girl,
    known only as Maya, proves to be a puzzle herself.

    As her story twists and turns, slowly shedding light on life in the Butterfly Garden, Maya reveals old grudges, new
    saviors, and horrific tales of a man who’d go to any length to hold beauty captive. But the more she shares, the
    more the agents have to wonder what she’s still hiding…</article>
